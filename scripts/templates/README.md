Command-line tool and Python library to interact with an [`aria2c`][1] daemon process through JSON-RPC.

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3999221/72664104-41658180-39fa-11ea-838e-022ed29d8c0b.gif)

To avoid confusion:

- [*aria2*][1] is a lightweight multi-protocol & multi-source, cross platform download utility operated in command-line.
It supports HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent and Metalink.
- `aria2c` is the name of the command-line executable provided by *aria2*. It can act as a daemon.
- `aria2p` (`p` for Python) is a command-line client that can interact with an `aria2c` daemon.
  It is not an official client. There are other Python packages allowing you to interact with an `aria2c` daemon.
  These other packages do not offer enough usability (in my opinion), this is why I'm developing `aria2p`.

**Purpose**: `aria2c` can run in the foreground, for one-time downloads, or in the background, as a daemon.
This is where `aria2p` intervenes: when an instance of `aria2c` is running in the background,
`aria2p` will be able to communicate with it to add downloads to the queue, remove, pause or resume them, etc.

In order for `aria2p` to be able to communicate with the `aria2c` process, RPC mode must be enabled
with the `--enable-rpc` option of `aria2c`. RPC stands for [Remote Procedure Call][2].
Although `aria2c` supports both JSON-RPC and XML-RPC protocols, `aria2p` **works with JSON only** (not XML).
More information about how to configure `aria2c` to run as a daemon with RPC mode enabled
can be found in the [Configuration section][conf doc] of the documentation.

## Requirements

`aria2p` requires Python 3.6 or above.

<details>
<summary>To install Python 3.6, I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><code>pyenv</code></a>.</summary>

```bash
# install pyenv
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ~/.pyenv

# setup pyenv (you should also put these three lines in .bashrc or similar)
export PATH="${HOME}/.pyenv/bin:${PATH}"
export PYENV_ROOT="${HOME}/.pyenv"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# install Python 3.6
pyenv install 3.6.8

# make it available globally
pyenv global system 3.6.8
```
</details>

You must also install [*aria2*][1]. On systems with `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install aria2
```

[1]: https://github.com/aria2/aria2
[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call

## Installation

With `pip`:

```bash
python3.6 -m pip install aria2p[tui]
```

With [`pipx`](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx):

```bash
python3.6 -m pip install --user pipx

pipx install --python python3.6 aria2p[tui]
```

The `tui` extra is needed for the interactive interface. If you don't need the interface (for example when you are
writing a Python package with a dependency to aria2p), simply install `aria2p` without any extra.

## Usage (as a library)

**This library is still a work in progress. More examples will be added later.
In the meantime, you can read the [Reference section](https://aria2p.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html) on the official documentation.**

```python
import aria2p

# initialization, these are the default values
aria2 = aria2p.API(aria2p.Client(host="http://localhost", port=6800, secret=""))

# list downloads
downloads = aria2.get_downloads()

for download in downloads:
    print(download.name, download.download_speed)

# add downloads
magnet_uri = "magnet:?xt=urn:..."

download = aria2.add_magnet(magnet_uri)
```

## Usage (command-line)

```
{{ main_usage }}
```

Calling `aria2p` without any arguments will by default call the `top` command,
which is a console interactive interface.

Commands:

{% for command in commands %}
- [`{{ command.name }}`](#{{ command.name }}){% endfor %}

{% for command in commands %}
---

### `{{ command.name }}`

```
{{ command.usage }}
```

{% if command.name == "call" -%}
As explained in the help text,
the `method` can be the exact method name,
or just the name without the prefix.
It is case-insensitive, and dashes and underscores will be removed.

The following are all equivalent:
- `aria2.addUri`
- `aria2.adduri`
- `addUri`
- `ADDURI`
- `aria2.ADD-URI`
- `add_uri`
- `A-d_D-u_R-i` (yes it's valid)
- `A---R---I---A---2.a__d__d__u__r__i` (I think you got it)
- and even more ugly forms...

#### Examples
List all available methods.
*This example uses [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq).*
```console
$ aria2p call listmethods | jq
[
  "aria2.addUri",
  "aria2.addTorrent",
  "aria2.getPeers",
  "aria2.addMetalink",
  "aria2.remove",
  "aria2.pause",
  "aria2.forcePause",
  "aria2.pauseAll",
  "aria2.forcePauseAll",
  "aria2.unpause",
  "aria2.unpauseAll",
  "aria2.forceRemove",
  "aria2.changePosition",
  "aria2.tellStatus",
  "aria2.getUris",
  "aria2.getFiles",
  "aria2.getServers",
  "aria2.tellActive",
  "aria2.tellWaiting",
  "aria2.tellStopped",
  "aria2.getOption",
  "aria2.changeUri",
  "aria2.changeOption",
  "aria2.getGlobalOption",
  "aria2.changeGlobalOption",
  "aria2.purgeDownloadResult",
  "aria2.removeDownloadResult",
  "aria2.getVersion",
  "aria2.getSessionInfo",
  "aria2.shutdown",
  "aria2.forceShutdown",
  "aria2.getGlobalStat",
  "aria2.saveSession",
  "system.multicall",
  "system.listMethods",
  "system.listNotifications"
]
```

List the GIDs (identifiers) of all active downloads.
*Note that we must give the parameters as a JSON string.*
```console
$ aria2p call tellactive -J '[["gid"]]'
[{"gid": "b686cad55029d4df"}, {"gid": "4b39a1ad8fd94e26"}, {"gid": "9d331cc4b287e5df"}, {"gid": "8c9de0df753a5195"}]
```

Pause a download using its GID.
*Note that when a single string argument is required, it can be passed directly with `-P`.*
```console
$ aria2p call pause -P b686cad55029d4df
"b686cad55029d4df"
```

Add a download using magnet URIs.
*This example uses `jq -r` to remove the quotation marks around the result.*
```console
$ aria2p call adduri -J '[["magnet:?xt=urn:..."]]' | jq -r
4b39a1ad8fd94e26f
```

Purge download results (remove completed downloads from the list).
```console
$ aria2p call purge_download_result
"OK"
```
{%- endif %}
{% endfor %}
